<h4>Why is ReactJS?<h4>
In building a social network, there are many different components that need to be designed and built, such as profiles, feeds, posts, comments, and more. By using ReactJS, each of these components can be isolated and developed independently, which makes it easier to manage and maintain the project over time.<br>
In conclusion, ReactJS is a good choice for building a front-end software project for a social network because of its ability to break down a user interface into reusable components, handle real-time updates, and be supported by a large and active community of developers
